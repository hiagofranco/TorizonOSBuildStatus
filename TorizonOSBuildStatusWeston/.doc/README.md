# Torizon OS Build Status - Weston #

This Weston instance makes it possible to display the dashboard on a local GUI
with a web browser.

The default configuration is modified so the wallpaper works as a splash screen
and the kiosk shell is used instead of the desktop.

## Testing ##

There is no need to test this specific application. It is recommended to test
the "Data Acquisition" part, which uses Grafana.
